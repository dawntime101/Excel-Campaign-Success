# Data-Boot-Camp-UT-Homework

A few different things we can draw from the Kickstarter campaign- Conclusion 1: Majority of the campaigns were launched in 2014-2016. 3151 campaigns were launched in these years alone, accounting for 77% of all 9 years. Conclusion 2: In those 3 years, only 48% were successful. Other than the first and last year in the campaign with a percentage lower than that, the other years all had roughly 75% successful. Conclusion 3: The Music Category was by far the most successful than any other with 540 successful campaigns and only 120 failed. But what was their roadblock? What caused them to fail. 

Some limitations of this data set are not knowing where the money  came from, or how it was obtained to reach their goals. We also do not know what barriers were faced that caused some to fail and others to succeed in each category.


Some other possible tables/ graphs could include the (what I had in mind is in the Bonus problem) so other than that, could be showing if it was staff pick, and whether it was successful or not. Also, could show currency and percent funded and whether it was successful or not.
